# Credit Risk Analysis
## Over of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to use six machine learning models to predict credit card risk. Using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libaries to build and evaluate models using resampling. The next part of the challenge was to use RandomOverSample SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. And to finalize the results BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier was used to compare the two maching learning models.
